Food trucks! Do I know them? Which ones do I know? Should I try new ones? Let's find out!

I got this idea from [this assessment repo](https://github.com/peck/engineering-assessment). That's why I'm looking at the SF food truck data. And I'm going to approach it much the same way they recommend approaching it there -- except that I'm going to spend more than two or three hours on it.  

I'm doing that because I've been looking for small projects to build to keep myself sharp while I'm looking for work, plus I haven't used Hotwire before and it sounds really interesting. So when I came across that repo, I says to myself I says, "this seems like a good one for the project."  

If you want to follow along in excruciating detail, here are some resources:

  - I'm using GH projects for the first time to organize my tickets: https://github.com/users/authorbeard/projects/1/views/1
  - I tend to write decent enough commit messages, which will be more verbose in this case.
  - I will collect those message and flesh them out in PR descriptions, when I do those.
  - Oh, and I'll be blogging about this: https://hamwater.wordpress.com
